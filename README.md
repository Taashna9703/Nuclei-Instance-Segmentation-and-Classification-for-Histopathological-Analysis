# Nuclei-Instance-Segmentation-and-Classification-for-Histopathological-Analysis
Deep learning excels in medical image analysis, especially segmenting nuclei from histopathology images. Deterministic models prioritize accuracy but lack confidence assessment. Our approach uses Deeplabv3+ for precise nuclei segmentation, addressing this limitation.
